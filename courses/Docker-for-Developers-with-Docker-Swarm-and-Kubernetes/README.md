### What is Docker?

<ul>
   <li>Docker is software that reduces the complexity of application setup/commands</li>
    <li>Where we configure containers, which are like servers to run our applications</li>
   <li>Easily, we can create independent environments that work on different OS`s</li>
   <li>And it still leaves performance projects</li>
</ul>

 

### Why Docker?

<ul>
    <li>Docker provides more speed in setting up a dev environment</li>
     <li>Little time spent on maintenance, containers run as configured</li>
    <li>Performance to run application, better than a VM</li>
    <li>Rescue us from the Matrix from Hell</li>
</ul>
   

### The Matrix From Hell

<p>
    Imagine a company that has computers to install various software. This would require a lot
    time. Imagine that this company has grown and now it needs these facilities resources to be also
    installed on other devices such as servers and/or in the cloud. This scenario illustrates what The Matrix From Hell is.
</p>
   
<p>
    The Docker being universal manages to meet these devices with the necessary installations.

   <li>Docker is divide in two versions: CE x EE</li>
    <li>CE is Community Edition, free edition, that possibility use Docker and is use in this course</li>
